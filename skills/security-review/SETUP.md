# security-review — Setup

## Freshness

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Owner** | software-builder maintainers |
| **Last reviewed** | 2026-08-22 |
| **Review cadence** | Quarterly — or when skill pipeline rules change |
| **External services** | None — reads supplied code/design content and repository only |

See [setup-freshness.md](../docs/skill-framework/shared/setup-freshness.md) for the shared contract.

## Install

```bash
cd software-builder
make install-security-review
```

Restart Cursor so the skill reloads.

### Claude Code only

```bash
cd software-builder
make install-claude-security-review
```

No restart needed — a new Claude Code session picks it up. See
[claude-code-setup.md](../docs/skill-framework/shared/claude-code-setup.md).

### Kiro / in-repo discovery

Working directly in this repo? `.cursor/rules/security-review.mdc` and
`.kiro/steering/security-review.md` point Cursor/Kiro at `security-review/SKILL.md` without an
install step.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Read-only repository access | No MCP required — analysis and report-drafting skill |

## Config

No config file. Pass inputs at invocation — see [workflow/inputs.md](workflow/inputs.md).

## Directory map

```
security-review/
  SKILL.md                 # Orchestrator (≤180 lines)
  examples.md
  workflow/                # Inputs → Analyze → Report
  reference/                # Phase index, report format, smoke/pressure tests
```

## Smoke test

After install, run the invocation in [reference/smoke-test.md](reference/smoke-test.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| A category is missing from the report entirely | Should never happen — every category gets a row per [reference/report-format.md](reference/report-format.md), populated or "None found"; file a bug if one is missing |
| Verdict says `Pass` but a category was actually unreachable | Bug — an unreachable category must land in `## Unknowns` and drive the verdict to `Blocked — insufficient access` per [workflow/report.md](workflow/report.md), never silently read as clean |
